# Self-Hosted Docker Services
This Includes General Configuration Steps and Includes Docker-Compose Files, All of This Was Configured on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Prerequisites
* Enough Storage for Your Particular Needs, I Used a 128GB Micro Sd-Card and for All the Services Above I Have Only Claimed 8GB of Space So Far.
* An Accessible Rasperry Pi With an Installed and Updated OS. I Had [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/Software/Operating-Systems/) (64-Bit) Installed Which Is Based on Debian Linux. Although What You Choose Is up to You, Just Make Sure You Know the Commands for That Particular Distro or OS.
* Static IP on the Raspberry Pi Is Highly Recommended.

## Installing Docker
To Get Started We Need to Install ```docker``` & ```docker-compose```.

Note: Installation Varies Depending on OS or Distro, Read and Follow the Instructions on How to Do It on Your OS/Distro, [Dockers Official Site](https://docs.docker.com/Desktop/Install/Debian/)
#### Docker on Debian 
``` Bash
curl -sSl https://get.docker.com | sh
```
If Youâ€™re Smarter Than Me, Avoid Running Linux as Admin/Root. Add Your User to the Docker Group to Skip Typing Sudo for Docker. You Might Have to Log Out and Log Back in for This to Work.
``` Bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${whoami}
```
Verify That Docker Is Installed by Running Your Very First Container.
``` Bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```
Install Docker Compose 
``` Bash
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```
Verify That It Worked
``` Bash
docker compose version
```

## Portainer
I Like to Keep Directories of Each Service That I Am Using and Putting the Correspondent docker-compose.yml File in Those Directories. 
##### Portainer Compose File
``` Bash
services:
  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
    ports:
      - 9443:9443
    volumes:
      - data:/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  data:
```
Run Portainer Using Compose File
``` Bash
docker compose up -d
```
It's That Simple, You Should Know be able to head to https://RaspberryPiIP:9443 in your browser and reach portainer.
