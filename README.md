This repo is a place to document my configuration and setup of my raspberry pi server. This includes general configuration steps, docker-compose files and other fun things. You can find the documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/Leviedt/rpi-docker-setups/wiki). The wiki is mainly for me to be able to learn and document my raspberry pi setup so it might miss some steps.
